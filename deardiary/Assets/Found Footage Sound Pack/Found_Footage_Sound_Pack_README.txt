ABOUT THE PACK

This pack includes 22 loopable ambient soundscapes, drones, and textures inspired by found footage aesthetics, Backrooms, and empty liminal spaces.  
Created using real destroyed cassette recorders, analog synthesizers, and ugly effects, each sound evokes the eerie stillness of abandoned malls, empty classrooms, and flickering VHS tapes.

Each track is delivered in:  
- WAV (24-bit, high quality)
